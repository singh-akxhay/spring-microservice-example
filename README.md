# spring-microservice-example

This is a simple Spring Microservices project consisting of two microservices, a Eureka server for service discovery, and an API gateway. The two microservices are named "Password Generator" and "Contacts Service." This project is designed to help you learn about building and deploying microservices using the Spring framework.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into the following components:

**1. Eureka Server:** This is used for service registration and discovery. It allows microservices to find and communicate with each other.

**2. API Gateway:** The API gateway is the entry point for external clients to access the microservices. It handles routing requests to the appropriate microservice.

**3. Password Generator:** A microservice responsible for generating random passwords.

**4. Contacts Service:** A microservice that manages contact information.

## Technologies Used
**1. Spring Boot:** The microservices are built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for creating microservices.

**2. Eureka:** Eureka is used for service discovery and registration.

**3. Spring Cloud Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway is used as the API gateway for routing requests to the microservices.

**4. Java:** The programming language used for building the microservices.

**5. Maven:** For project management and dependency handling.
